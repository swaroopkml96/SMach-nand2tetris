# SMach-nand2tetris
## Building a computer from scratch  

A simulated machine - Hardware, Assembler, Virtual Machine Translator, Compiler and an OS - Mainly Java   
These are our solutions to the projects in 'The elements of computing systems' or nand2tetris.  
See http://www.nand2tetris.org/  

We had a lot of fun working on this project, and learned a lot. We've tried very hard to make the code readable.

A quick introduction:  
**The Chips** are written in HDL and describe the simulated machine (the HACK platform)  
**The Assembler** assembles programs in the assembly language described in the book into machine code.  
**The VMTranslator** translates VM code into assmebly code  
**The Compiler** compiles JACK programs into VM code.  
**The OS**, is a library of classes that help with I/O and a few other things.
