# SMach-nand2tetris
Building a computer from scratch

A simulated machine - chips, assembler, Virtual Machine Translator, Compiler and an OS - In Java 

These are my solutions to the projects in 'The elements of computing systems' or nand2tetris.

See http://www.nand2tetris.org/

I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I learned a lot. I've tried very hard to make the code readable. If you find the comments long and unnecessary, do what the compiler does best and ignore them :p

A quick introduction:

**The Chips** are written in HDL and describe the simulated machine (the HACK platform)
**The Assembler** assembles programs in the assembly language described in the book into machine code.
**The VMTranslator** translates VM code into assmebly code
**The Compiler** compiles JACK programs into VM code.
**The OS**, is a library of classes that help with I/O and a few other things.

If you haven't read the book, I recommend you do. You'll never look at your computer in the same way again :)
